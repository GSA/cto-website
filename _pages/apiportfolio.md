# GSA API Management Shared Services Portfolio

GSA is developing an IT shared services strategy to improve the delivery of common IT capabilities to support GSA’s mission. Our goal is to reduce IT costs, increase collaboration across the delivery teams, and enhance the overall customer experience.

API Management is one of GSA IT’s shared services. We established a working group, titled the API Management Portfolio, to support the Internal Engagement and Technical Architecture pillars of the [GSA API Strategy](/guides/API_strategy).

The group is comprised of GSA IT representatives and meets monthly to discuss the following goals and objectives:

- Develop a centralized directory of non-public APIs  
- Perform API technology analysis
- Develop an internal marketing/communications campaign
- Expand reviewers of API Standards in GSA IT offices
- Develop non-public/internal API guides

For more information,  please contact the CTO team using the contact information at the bottom of this page.
