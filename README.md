# CTO Website

This is the website for the GSA Office of the Chief Technology Officer.

## Architecture

This is a Jekyll-based website designed to be published via GitHub Pages.
However, it may be migrated to the [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/)
platform in the future.

Since this is designed to be a GitHub Pages site, our default Git branch is
`gh-pages`.

The website utilizes the [US Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/).
