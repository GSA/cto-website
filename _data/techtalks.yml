     <p>Building Tools to Help Privacy Officers Better Protect Personal Information</p>    
     <p>Protecting the privacy of Americans is an essential function of our government and every agency has dedicated professionals who ensure that their agency is responsible for collecting and maintaining private information in its systems.</p>
     <p>The problem is that many of these folks, called privacy officers, are not equipped with modern tools and many rely on paper-based processes to do their important work. This is a problem that seemed ripe for 10x investigation.</p>
     <p>Over four phases of research and engineering, all while working closely with privacy offices across government, 10x has been able to address this gap by building a custom dashboard that allows privacy officers to do their jobs more quickly and more efficiently by quickly locating over 5,884 records based on the types of private information that is held in systems across government.     </p>

  date: March 18, 2020
  time: 1-130p
  location: Rm 5007
  description: >
      <p>Traditional approaches to IT network security are based on the castle-and-moat concept. In castle-and-moat security, it is hard to obtain access from outside the network, but once inside the network, users are more or less considered trusted.</p>
      <p>The problem with this approach is that once an attacker gains access to the network, they have more free reign over everything inside.</p>
      <p>Zero Trust Network (ZTN) security is an IT security framework that requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are sitting within or outside of the network perimeter.</p>
      <p>No single specific technology is associated with zero trust; it is a holistic approach to network security that incorporates several different principles and technologies. In this tech talk, we introduce Zero Trust Network and GSA’s roadmap towards this security framework.</p>

       <p>GSA IT, working in partnership with the Office of Administrative Services, developed a solution in support of email records management (ERM).
       <p>ERM is important because maintaining messages beyond the records retention period poses a risk to the agency through eDiscovery.</p>
       <p>The ERM working group developed a procedure of expunging from the GSA email system messages that are older than seven fiscal years.
       <p>So that users may preserve any of those older messages for personal reference use, GSA IT developed a Chrome extension that allows users to save those message outside the GSA email system--in this case Google Drive.
       <p>The Chrome extension saves messages as PDF documents and includes any attachments in their native form.
       <p>Without this tool users will have to print each message as PDF and manually combine with any attachments to store outside GSA email system.</p>

  description: >
        <p>Identifying the right problem to solve is often overlooked when planning a new project. Problems are often framed as, we need to achieve compliance with "X" rather than our solution should make it easier to comply with "X".</p>
        <p>Going about this process in a systematic way can be a challenge, it's not every day that you work to tackle the big problems within an organization.</p>
        <p>Sprint is a book written by two ex-Googler's who undertook many such challenges when working with clients to transform the way they work.</p>
        <p>Sprint focuses on a 5 day, intensive set of sessions to break down issues, center the team on the right problems to solve, and produce prototypes quickly.</p>

  location: Virtual and 1800F Room 2002
  description: >
   <p>Below is this Tech Talk’s Objective.  All are welcome, but it is a more Technical topic than most Tech Talks
   <p>Milner's slogan "Well typed programs can't go wrong" characterizes type-safe computation
   <p>Strongly typed languages with static type checking allow both parametric polymorphism and lifting their logic to the type system. This constructive logic is sound and complete. UML templates allow us to represent such type-safe computation in a technical architecture.
   <p>Rick will introduce parametric and logical types for programming and architecture with examples from both Java Generics and UML templates. Participants are encouraged to read Rick's paper "Parametric and Logical Types for Model-Driven Engineering" before the talk.
   <p>We will discuss the results of industrial research on static type systems used by Facebook (Flow) and Microsoft (TypeScript) with JavaScript. We will identify adoption risk of weakly and dynamically typed languages such as Perl, PHP and Python.

    <p>Have you ever read an IT Strategic Plan with jargon and buzzwords that left you scratching your head and saying, "What did I just read?".   When was the last time you referenced an IT Strategic Plan and remembered the goals, mission, or vision?  An IT Strategic Plan should be clear, concise, and understandable to all audiences.</p>
    <p>For our latest GSA IT Strategic Plan (FY 2018-2020,) GSA IT used a new strategic planning approach based on the industry best practice, Balanced Scorecard.  The Balanced Scorecard  is a system that connects an organization's strategy with performance management and simplifies how we communicate what we are trying to accomplish.  A key principle of the Balanced Scorecard is how we view our IT strategy through four perspectives - customers, stewardship ($), internal processes, and organization growth (our people, tools, and technology).</p>
    <p>This TechTalk will discuss the new strategic planning process we took to develop the GSA IT Strategic Plan and involve over 75+ employees in the strategy sessions.</p>

  description: Slack is a chat client that provides a centralized way to communicate in channels that you want--about projects that matter to you--without overloading your inbox. The name is actually an acronym for "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge". It will not replace our current tools such as gmail, hangouts, google docs, Chatter etc… In fact, within Slack you can share links to content from those tools in a seamless way, to work directly with team members on specific projects. For example, if you work with a core group of people on a project, you can work within a specific channel (that you can request be created) to converse, share documents, and have a searchable log of all of your activity.

Go ahead and create- wait, you made the subnets already, right? What about the Security Groups?" Sound familiar? Manual setup and configuration of infrastructure can be time-consuming, tedious, confusing, and error-prone. Computers are really good at following instructions - why don’t we let the computers follow the instructions for us? Better yet, what if there were a tool where we tell it what we want the infrastructure to look like, and it magically figures out how to build it? This talk will make you wonder how you ever lived without infrastructure as code, and show how Terraform can be used to turn your devops up to 11.

- title: Taxonomy Tech Talk with Angela Pitts
  date: January 25, 2018
  time: 1p-1:30p
  location: Virtual and 1800F Room 4143
  description: In the world of Knowledge Management, Taxonomy is a discipline focused on the building of classically structured hierarchies of terms that are used to represent defined concepts. Typically, the hierarchy which is leveraged within a system is also called a taxonomy. The system employs the taxonomy to classify documents, digital assets and other information. In addition to categorizing content to improve findability (navigation and search), a taxonomy also allows content to be discovered. In these fast-paced times, taxonomies are expanding beyond the classic hierarchy to include semantic networks (often referred to as ontologies), thesauri and established lexicons (controlled vocabularies). Leveraging new tools,  taxonomy development and maintenance can ideally fit into any Continuous Improvement plan. The use of new strategies and tools also promotes interoperability and improves the flow of information through enterprise systems. As a result, organizational barriers continue to be broken down so information can be more effectively used and reused.

In fact, what if those questions could be answered and we could drive both ourselves and our users to more efficient and effective uses of our IT? This answer does exist within our Cost Transparency Initiative, utilizing Technology Business Management.  Please join us for this TechTalks to learn more about cost transparency and how we can shape business demand and deliver value for money.

- title: 'The Agile Product Owner: Beyond the Books & Classrooms'
  date: June 6, 2017
  time: 1p-1:30p
  location: Virtual and 1800F
  description:
    <p>As organizations embark on Agile transformation, many traditional project managers or business and technical leads are often assigned the Product Owner role with limited (or no) training or even an understanding of what the new role truly entails. In the midst of changing environments, conflicting mindsets, and other change-related issues, they are expected to start operating within a Scrum team after a few days of CSPO training and perhaps some reading. So, what are some of the tools and real-life experience required from a Product Owner?</p>
    <p>During this Tech Talk, Alicia Cyrus will explore the differences between product ownership and traditional project management, and share some approaches on how Product Owners can effectively manage relationships and the responsibilities of their new role.</p>
