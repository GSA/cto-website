    <p>Cloud.gov is the TTS-operated platform-as-a-service for the federal government.</p>
    <p>So, what is it, how does it work, and how can you get started with it?</p>
    <p>Peter with the cloud.gov team will walk you through deploying a database-backed web application, and illustrate how cloud.gov is different from other cloud offerings.</p>
    <p>In particular, the Cloud Foundry-based PaaS offloads much of the work that IaaSes require for security and compliance -- saving you money and vastly speeding up time to delivery.</p>

  date: April 16, 2018
  time: 1-1:30p
  location: Virtual and 1800F Room 2002                          
  description: >
   <p>Below is this Tech Talk’s Objective.  All are welcome, but it is a more Technical topic than most Tech Talks 
   <p>Milner's slogan "Well typed programs can't go wrong" characterizes type-safe computation
   <p>Strongly typed languages with static type checking allow both parametric polymorphism and lifting their logic to the type system. This constructive logic is sound and complete. UML templates allow us to represent such type-safe computation in a technical architecture.
   <p>Rick will introduce parametric and logical types for programming and architecture with examples from both Java Generics and UML templates. Participants are encouraged to read Rick's paper "Parametric and Logical Types for Model-Driven Engineering" before the talk.
   <p>We will discuss the results of industrial research on static type systems used by Facebook (Flow) and Microsoft (TypeScript) with JavaScript. We will identify adoption risk of weakly and dynamically typed languages such as Perl, PHP and Python.

- title: GSA IT Strategy with Balanced Scorecard
  date: March 8, 2018
  time: 1-1:30p
  location: Virtual and 1800F Room 3143
  description: >
    <p>Have you ever read an IT Strategic Plan with jargon and buzzwords that left you scratching your head and saying, "What did I just read?".   When was the last time you referenced an IT Strategic Plan and remembered the goals, mission, or vision?  An IT Strategic Plan should be clear, concise, and understandable to all audiences.</p>
    <p>For our latest GSA IT Strategic Plan (FY 2018-2020,) GSA IT used a new strategic planning approach based on the industry best practice, Balanced Scorecard.  The Balanced Scorecard  is a system that connects an organization's strategy with performance management and simplifies how we communicate what we are trying to accomplish.  A key principle of the Balanced Scorecard is how we view our IT strategy through four perspectives - customers, stewardship ($), internal processes, and organization growth (our people, tools, and technology).</p>
    <p>This TechTalk will discuss the new strategic planning process we took to develop the GSA IT Strategic Plan and involve over 75+ employees in the strategy sessions.</p>

  date: March 1, 2018
  time: 1-1:30p
  location: Virtual and 1800F Room 5115
  description: Slack is a chat client that provides a centralized way to communicate in channels that you want--about projects that matter to you--without overloading your inbox. The name is actually an acronym for "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge". It will not replace our current tools such as gmail, hangouts, google docs, Chatter etc… In fact, within Slack you can share links to content from those tools in a seamless way, to work directly with team members on specific projects. For example, if you work with a core group of people on a project, you can work within a specific channel (that you can request be created) to converse, share documents, and have a searchable log of all of your activity.

  description: >
    "Ok, to set up this system, go to the EC2 page in the Console, then click ‘New Instance’. Oh, sorry, that button moved - go to the Instances page first. Go ahead and create- wait, you made the subnets already, right? What about the Security Groups?" Sound familiar? Manual setup and configuration of infrastructure can be time-consuming, tedious, confusing, and error-prone. Computers are really good at following instructions - why don’t we let the computers follow the instructions for us? Better yet, what if there were a tool where we tell it what we want the infrastructure to look like, and it magically figures out how to build it? This talk will make you wonder how you ever lived without infrastructure as code, and show how Terraform can be used to turn your devops up to 11.

- title: Taxonomy Tech Talk with Angela Pitts
  date: January 25, 2018
  time: 1p-1:30p
  location: Virtual and 1800F Room 4143
  description: In the world of Knowledge Management, Taxonomy is a discipline focused on the building of classically structured hierarchies of terms that are used to represent defined concepts. Typically, the hierarchy which is leveraged within a system is also called a taxonomy. The system employs the taxonomy to classify documents, digital assets and other information. In addition to categorizing content to improve findability (navigation and search), a taxonomy also allows content to be discovered. In these fast-paced times, taxonomies are expanding beyond the classic hierarchy to include semantic networks (often referred to as ontologies), thesauri and established lexicons (controlled vocabularies). Leveraging new tools,  taxonomy development and maintenance can ideally fit into any Continuous Improvement plan. The use of new strategies and tools also promotes interoperability and improves the flow of information through enterprise systems. As a result, organizational barriers continue to be broken down so information can be more effectively used and reused.

IDI, security, and application development leads) to define and build DevSecOps framework to help migrate application workloads to cloud. The goal is to ‘develop/deploy/operate’ through automation. As part of this journey, the CTO team worked closely with the D2D team to migrate D2D applications to cloud by building some of these automation pieces and work towards that final goal of developing automated CI/CD pipelines. In this presentation, we will go over the D2D migration steps in detail and understand how DevSecOps automation process can help build repeatable infrastructure/application deployments with minimal manual intervention, and shorter provisioning times.

  description:
    <p>As organizations embark on Agile transformation, many traditional project managers or business and technical leads are often assigned the Product Owner role with limited (or no) training or even an understanding of what the new role truly entails. In the midst of changing environments, conflicting mindsets, and other change-related issues, they are expected to start operating within a Scrum team after a few days of CSPO training and perhaps some reading. So, what are some of the tools and real-life experience required from a Product Owner?</p>
    <p>During this Tech Talk, Alicia Cyrus will explore the differences between product ownership and traditional project management, and share some approaches on how Product Owners can effectively manage relationships and the responsibilities of their new role.</p>
