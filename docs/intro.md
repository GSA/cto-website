Much of this guidance will be specific to your individual projects, however **there are a number of requirements that nearly every GSA website must follow** and this guide is designed to help guide you, the developer, through them. It's by no means a complete reference to a 100% compliant GSA website, but it will build a strong foundation for your project's future success.

## Getting Started

Before we can get started, **you'll need to ensure you have a few prerequisites configured with your project**.

### Prerequisites

- [**U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)**](https://designsystem.digital.gov)<br />GSA relies on USWDS for the various components it requires on websites. For this reason, USWDS must be installed and operating as expected before moving forward.

- [**EDX Chrome Extension**](https://github.com/GSA/EDX-chrome-extension)<br />While not strictly requiried, this extension is helpful to both techincal and non-techincal users to validate that required GSA elements are present on the current webpage.
