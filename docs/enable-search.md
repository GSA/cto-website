# Enable search

GSA websites intended for use by the public must include a search box.

:::info
Publicly accessible websites that don’t have on-site search should **[contact Search.gov](mailto:search@support.digitalgov.gov)** to get started. See the **[Search.gov Launch Guide](https://search.gov/manual/site-launch-guide.html)** for additional guidance.
:::

Regardless of which search tool you use, follow this high-level technical guidance for on-site search:

- Decide which domains and subdomains you want to include in your search experience. Ensure that your search tool can provide results across all the content you want to include. (Search.gov can provide cross-domain results. Many other tools cannot do this.)
- Publish XML sitemaps for each domain and subdomain.
- Check if your search tool can include content from RSS feeds and social media, and decide which content you want to include in your search experience.
- Customize what searchers see via “best bets,” and review your search results page to ensure the design is consistent with your website.
- Confirm **[third-party scripts](https://search.gov/manual/third-party.html)** for your DAP, independent Google Analytics, and customer satisfaction surveys, etc., are on your search results page.
