The GSA is fully embracing Agile as a core methodology for not only developing new IT capabilities, but also how it operates and executes the development of policy, practice, and other elements of our business. These guides are focused on how we invest and build software and systems, primarily.

Our intent is to be descriptive at an agency level through policy and best practice and proscriptive at a program and team level, tuning the specifics agile implementations to the needs of the business and implementation teams.

We start each pilot with the same processes and intake, to create standardized approaches to how we are doing Agile and using those to create a culture of delivery and agility across the agency.
