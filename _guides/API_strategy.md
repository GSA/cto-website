GSA promotes an API-first approach for making its solutions optimal for data transparency, data consumer engagement, application development, and the like. This assists with opening systems and data sets for further system integration by allowing the movement of data from legacy systems for use and design of new solutions via new open technologies.

We are adopting industry best practices with API design, development, and management. Our approach to APIs is found in our [API Strategy]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/GSAAPIStrategy.pdf).
