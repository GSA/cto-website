Intro sentences

### Decoding the Terminology
Agile is not a process, methodology, or a specific tool. **Agile is a mindset.** The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) fully details the [values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/) that comprise Agile behavior, which we summarize in [Agile Adoption]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/agile_adoption/). It also includes some common terminology, an introduction to the benefits of Agile culture, and behaviors we can adapt to becoming more Agile.

In [Popular Approaches to Agile Adoption]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/popular_approaches/), we highlight the most notable Agile frameworks [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) and [Kanban](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/what-is-kanban/), and discuss their values, common terms, roles, ceremonies, and how teams can get started with each approach. However, Agile adoption is not always an easy transition; shifting the mindset of an organization and its people can present many challenges. [Agile Adoption Challenges and Best Practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Agile_Adoption_Challenges_and_Best_Practices/) features some of the major challenges to Agile adoption and recommends various mitigation techniques.

Despite the challenges, the benefits of an Agile environment can far outweigh the growing pains, as introduced in Agile Adoption at GSA. [Visibility & Status in an Agile Environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/visibility_and_status/) further discusses how creating an Agile environment can better support Business and IT [collaboration]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Business_and_IT_Collaboration/), transparency, visibility, communication, and accountability.

### AIOps
The success of an Agile implementation begins “at the top” - it requires the full support of executive and managerial leadership. The GSA provides support of Agile adoption through Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). As part of the GSA IT vision, we have committed to building a supportive environment for iterative and open-source development. The [U.S. Digital Service Playbook]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/digital_services_playbook/) and [18F: Agile Principles and Practices](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/) outline the practices that have been put in place to support Agile and iterative development environment by the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). 

#### MLOps
Moreover, we understand that continued success throughout an organizational Agile implementation is not only supported by [Applying Agile Practices to Business Teams]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/applying_agile_practices/), but also helping organizations find ways to transition [Traditional Management Skills and Functions in an Agile Organization]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Traditional-Management-Skills-and-Functions-in-an-Agile-Organization/) and identify [Measures of Success in an Agile Organization]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/measures-agile-success/). Further, while Agile practices are often relegated to projects / processes within Information Technology, many other industries have developed innovative and strategic Agile methods which we detail in [Agile Human Resources (HR)]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/applying_agile_practices_HR/), [Agile Legal]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/applying_agile_practices_legal/), and [Agile Marketing]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/applying_agile_practices_marketing/).
