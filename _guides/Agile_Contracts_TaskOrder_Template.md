This content provides contract language guidance and is intended to serve as a template for the government representative during the development of a Task Order under an Agile BPA. The sample language provided here can be used to clearly outline and communicate the high-level objectives and task-level delivery requirements of the intended product / service in line with an Agile delivery process. Additionally, this Task Order structure enables the government to allow contractors to work in a flexible way while maintaining high expectations for code quality and successful agile project management.
