### Scrum Meetings AKA Ceremonies

**1. Sprint Planning**

|**The Meeting** | **Tips and Benefits**
|---------------|---------------|

|**How it is conducted:** {::nomarkdown}<ul><li> The Product Owner defines the Sprint Goal - a short description of what the sprint will attempt to achieve, clarifies the details on backlog items and their respective acceptance criteria </li> <li> These entries are updated and broken into smaller stories by the team so that they can be completed within one Sprint.</li> <li>The stories are estimated, prioritized and tasked.</li> <li>The Scrum Team defines their capacity for the upcoming Sprint - the total capacity of the Scrum Team might change from Sprint to Sprint. In order to come to realistic commitments it is necessary to know the total capacity of the team for the upcoming Sprint considering e.g. vacations, public holidays, efforts for Scrum Meetings and time needed for other activities during the Sprint.</li> <li>Tasks are taken up by the team members based on their experience levels and expertise</li> <li>The team is ready to start with the daily sprints.</li></ul>{:/} |**Useful Tips:** {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Timebox the meeting.
