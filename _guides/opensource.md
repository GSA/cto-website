We are currently developing our internal policy and inventorying all of our code repos for publication on [code.gov](https://code.gov/).  More information will be posted here soon on our progress in complying with [M-16-21](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/) and contributing to an open coding ecosystem.

The [Open Source website](https://open.gsa.gov/code/) will be a site to spread our knowledge of Open Source Software (OSS) when possible with recently being asked to share our policy with all CFO Act agencies.  Agencies are considering our policy as they develop theirs.

We believe in being "open first" with working to realize 100% open source code across the Agency.  While we may be a little ways away from being fully 100% open source, we take pride in being the government (and industry) standard for open sourcing.

We have a few things underway, including the automation of OSS inventory and review [files in the repository](https://open.gsa.gov/oss-implementation/)
