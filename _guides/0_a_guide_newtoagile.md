Are you new to Agile? Trying to understand how this approach to project management differs from more traditional methods? Wondering how this will affect projects at the General Services Administration (GSA)? The CTO Team and [TECH.GSA.GOV]({{ site.baseurl }}) can help! This guide will direct you through the content and resources we offer in regards to [Embracing Agile]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/embracing_agile/).

### Understanding Agile
Agile is not a process, methodology, or a specific tool. **Agile is a mindset.** The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) fully details the [values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/) that comprise Agile behavior, which we summarize in [Agile Adoption]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/agile_adoption/). It also includes some common terminology, an introduction to the benefits of Agile culture, and behaviors we can adapt to becoming more Agile.

In [Popular Approaches to Agile Adoption]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/popular_approaches/), we highlight the most notable Agile frameworks [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) and [Kanban](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/what-is-kanban/), and discuss their values, common terms, roles, ceremonies, and how teams can get started with each approach. However, Agile adoption is not always an easy transition; shifting the mindset of an organization and its people can present many challenges. [Agile Adoption Challenges and Best Practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Agile_Adoption_Challenges_and_Best_Practices/) features some of the major challenges to Agile adoption and recommends various mitigation techniques.

Despite the challenges, the benefits of an Agile environment can far outweigh the growing pains, as introduced in Agile Adoption at GSA. [Visibility & Status in an Agile Environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/visibility_and_status/) further discusses how creating an Agile environment can better support transparency, visibility, communication, and accountability.

### Implementing Agile at the Organizational Level
The success of an Agile implementation begins “at the top” - it requires the full support of executive and managerial leadership. The GSA provides support of Agile adoption through Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). As part of the GSA IT vision, we have committed to building a supportive environment for iterative and open-source development. The [U.S. Digital Service Playbook]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/digital_services_playbook/) and [18F: Agile Principles and Practices](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/) outline the practices that have been put in place to support Agile and iterative development environment by the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). 

#### Agile Practices
Moreover, we understand that continued success throughout an organizational Agile implementation is supported by [Applying Agile Practices to Business Teams]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/applying_agile_practices/). Often Agile practices are relegated to Information Technology projects, but many other industries have developed innovative and strategic Agile methods which we detail in [Agile Human Resources (HR)]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/applying_agile_practices_HR/), [Agile Legal]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/applying_agile_practices_legal/), and [Agile Marketing]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/applying_agile_practices_marketing/).

#### Agile Investment
The CTO Office continues to champion Agile adoption through the Agile Investment Process as described in the [Agile Investment Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/agile_investment_overview/). It illustrates the five-phased approach to piloting potential IT investments, its benefits, and building [Business and IT Collaboration]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Business_and_IT_Collaboration/). [Taking an Agile Investment Approach]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/agile_investment_approach/) extends the discussion into the needs for a successful pilot, including the supporting Scrum roles and ceremonies.

*The expectations and outputs for concepts submitted through the Agile Investment process are outlined in the [Discovery Phase Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/agile_investment_discovery_phase_checklist/) and [Proof Of Concept (PoC) Phase Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Agile_Investment_Proof-Of-Concept_phase_checklist/).*

### Implementing Agile at the Project / Product Level
Agile adoption at the organizational level creates a transparent, responsive, and flexible environment that is readily able to handle change in the market. However, we recognize that not every *project or product* will benefit from an Agile approach, those that do are typically large and complex in nature. Those that do are typically large and complex in nature as we note in [How to Determine Projects Fit for Agile]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/How_to_Determine_Projects_Fit_for_Agile/). In [Agile vs. Waterfall - Scope, Schedule and Cost]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Agilevs.Waterfall_Scope_Schedule_and_Cost/), we explore the main differences in *why* you would select an Agile approach versus a traditional project management approach for a project / product.

#### Agile Approaches
The CTO Team provides Agile coaching, resources, and guidance in the Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps approaches. Regardless of the framework used, the goal is to continuously improve upon iterative development and encourage [Collaboration Across Agile Teams]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Collaboration_Across_Agile_Teams/). We can walk you through [Conducting an Agile Project]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/conducting_an_agile_project/) and provide guidance on [Managing Requirements in an Agile Environment]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/managing_requirements/), [Defining When a Requirement is Complete]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/requirements_complete/), [Writing Effective User Stories]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/effective_user_stories/), [Estimation & Story Pointing]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/estimation_and_storypointing/), and facilitating successful [Agile Meetings Goals and Benefits]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Agile_Meetings_Goals_and_Benefits/).

#### Agile Contracts
As efforts progress, Business groups may require procurement of Agile resources to fill project roles through a contract. The CTO Team has worked with various groups across GSA IT and outside organizations, including Contracts and Acquisition, to develop the [Agile Contracts - PWS Template]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Agile_Contracts_PWS_Template/) (also available in a downloadable MS Word format). The template provides contract language guidelines and sample language for procuring resources through an Agile BPA. Further, we have comprised interview questions for [Agile Vendors]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Agile_Contracts_Interview_Questions_for_Agile_Vendors/) and [Agile Roles]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/AgileContracts_Interview_Questions_for_Agile_Roles/) to ensure informed selection of the right approach and skillsets for a successful Agile project / product delivery process. 

*For frequently-asked, high-level questions regarding Agile, check out the [Agile FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/Agile_FAQs/). For various terminology used throughout the content, the [Agile Glossary]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/agile_glossary/) provides an up-to-date reference. Additionally, most content cites sources used or a “Good Reads” section that includes reference information.*
