Have you ever needed a new software loaded onto your work laptop?

Where do you start, who do you contact, what information do you even need to begin?

Never fear the GSA IT Standards team is here!!

We will take you through the steps of acquiring the software you need.  We will start in GEAR searching through GSA approved software that can be used, to searching GEAR for an alternative that may meet your need.

We will discuss our 'New Software' request form, talk about why we ask the questions we do, and how your responses can assist us in moving your ticket through the approval process.

We want to share with you the steps we must complete, the reviews that are required, and the approvals that must be acquired.

We also want to hear from you, so join us on April 26th and bring your questions.
