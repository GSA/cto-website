Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a valuable method to share data with mobile apps, websites, and computer systems. GSA publishes many Public APIs for use outside of GSA. We also have many Non-Public APIs that are used to share functionality or data between GSA systems.

There is even a group inside GSA named the "GSA API Guild" that is dedicated solely to API best practices.

This tech talk will give a brief overview of APIs, along with an update on the agency's activity with APIs in 2019 and goals for 2020.
