As technology has evolved and federal space has been reduced, the need for managing both physical and electronic records has grown in scale and complexity. In response to these challenges, EDMS Record Management Module helps GSA  comply with federal records management statutes and regulations.

The Records Management Module (RMM) is a fully integrated component of the EDMS application and has already been utilized to declare over 3 million GSA documents as records, and growing.

On the tech Talk, there will be a demo of the RMM module, how content is declared a record and also what has been declared a record and how the RMM aligns with the NARA RM initiative.
