IT applications are getting more robust and complicated each year.  Applications developers are expected to deliver more features while improving application performance for end users.

This can be a challenging endeavor without the right tool to baseline and track application performance and identify where the bottlenecks are occurring.

During this tech talk, Phil Klokis and Allen Samuel will present how PB-ITS has used Riverbed ARX to improve application performance and identify usage of the application in supporting application rationalization activities.
