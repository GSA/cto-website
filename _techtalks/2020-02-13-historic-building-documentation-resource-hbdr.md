This talk is an overview of the Historic Building Documentation Resource (HBDR), also known as the BPP transition project. PBS-IT is currently managing the development of the HBDR interface for use by both the Center for Historic Buildings and supporting project teams assessing and rehabilitating historic buildings.

The goal is to offer a simplified solution for management of BPP data and related supporting documents while leveraging the power of the EDMS Alfresco environment.

We will review several of these capabilities today designed in Alfresco for the HBDR interface which contribute to the ease of BPP management and increased productivity for users.
