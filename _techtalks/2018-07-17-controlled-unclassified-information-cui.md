The Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Program is coming to GSA! This new program, to be implemented across all Executive Branch agencies, will standardize the way agencies mark, handle, and share information that is unclassified but requires protection. Types of information that will be affected include PII, SBU, legal info, contracts, bids, etc. Tune in July 17th to learn more about the program and implementation plans for GSA.
