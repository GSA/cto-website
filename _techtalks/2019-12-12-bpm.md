In this first of upcoming BPM related Tech Talks, you will learn about optimizing your organizational processes through simulation with Trisotech, an enterprise tool suite.

Author and Enterprise Architect practitioner Dr. Joshua Fuehrer will discuss how you can use Trisotech to model and simulate to-be changes to business processes in order to examine if desired changes will make an impact. Josh will dive into Trisotech capabilities for simulation and provide an in-depth look at how you can lead within your organisation to help transform their business model; from both an efficiency and effectiveness perspective.

We are looking to continue this BPM topic in future tech talks which will include case management, capability or strategic management, and decision modeling.
