Andrew Starling (IAE) and Dan Perkins (GSA IT Section 508 team) have worked together in conducting Section 508 testing during the design and development of beta.sam.gov.

This Tech Talk will provide an overview of their Section 508 testing processes and how they complement each other.

Mark Buchko (GSA IT Section 508 team) will also give an overview of the automated testing tool AMP (Accessibility Management Platform by Level Access) that is available to everyone in GSA.

This is the second tech talk related to the topic of IT Standards.
