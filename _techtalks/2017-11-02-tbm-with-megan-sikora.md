Ever find yourself always trying to answer the question of why IT costs what it does or a cost per user?  Do your customers want more information as to what drives the cost of the services GSA IT delivers, but you find yourself answering questions with more question? What if there was a standard taxonomy and model that once loaded with the copious amounts of data that we possess that could answer those questions? In fact, what if those questions could be answered and we could drive both ourselves and our users to more efficient and effective uses of our IT? This answer does exist within our Cost Transparency Initiative, utilizing Technology Business Management.  Please join us for this TechTalks to learn more about cost transparency and how we can shape business demand and deliver value for money.
