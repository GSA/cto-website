The Chief Technology Office (CTO) TechRadar partners with GSA offices and Federal agencies to accelerate emerging tech assessment, alignment, and action by connecting Federal innovators with new content and collaborators to create new value.

We currently have the following technologies analyzed on our website and the list will grow over time: 3D Printing, AIOps, Virtual Presence, and Augmented Reality
