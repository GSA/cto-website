The 10x program crowdsources ideas from federal employees all across the government and turns them into technology projects that improve the public's experience with government.

10x will be funding new projects in April, which means now is a good time to submit your ideas.

At this tech talk, Will Cahoe will give a brief overview of how 10x works, discuss the specific topic areas that 10x wants ideas around, and give some advice for writing excellent submissions.
