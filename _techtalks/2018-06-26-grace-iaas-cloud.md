GRACE is the new GSA enterprise cloud platform offering. The platform offers near full automation of IaaS capability to quickly on-board new tenants and empower them with self-provisioning capability.

So, what is it, how does it work, and how can you get started with it? Kishore from the CTO team will provide information on the core principles, architecture details, automation workflow, and core components of the GRACE platform.

We will talk about “why GRACE?” and compare it with other GSA’s IaaS offerings. We will also briefly touch on “incremental ATO process”, which is being developed in collaboration with the security team to build GRACE platform.

This is another interesting Tech Talk related to the topic of the Cloud!
