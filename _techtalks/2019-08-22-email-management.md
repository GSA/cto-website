GSA IT, working in partnership with the Office of Administrative Services, developed a solution in support of email records management (ERM).

ERM is important because maintaining messages beyond the records retention period poses a risk to the agency through eDiscovery.

The ERM working group developed a procedure of expunging from the GSA email system messages that are older than seven fiscal years.

So that users may preserve any of those older messages for personal reference use, GSA IT developed a Chrome extension that allows users to save those message outside the GSA email system--in this case Google Drive.

The Chrome extension saves messages as PDF documents and includes any attachments in their native form.

Without this tool users will have to print each message as PDF and manually combine with any attachments to store outside GSA email system.
