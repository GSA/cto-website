Many of us could use a little help in understanding some of the more technical aspects of the new "Controlled Unclassified Information" (CUI) program that GSA implemented July 1st.

Would you like to know more about how the new CUI program works, and what makes it different from SBU, FOUO, Confidential, Sensitive, and other markings that were used in the past? Do you need a little clarification understanding all of the different CUI categories and not sure which one to use for your data?

Our CUI PMO will offer a Tech Talk to help kick-start you in the right direction so you can do your part as a valued GSA employee to help protect our data.
