Like most organizations, GSA IT is embracing the shared services model to optimize common IT functions to more efficiently meet GSA's mission of delivering best value in real estate, acquisition and technology services. This means re-evaluating the way GSA IT defines and creates IT solutions and investment strategies for the enterprise.

In 2016, GSA IT established Solutions Strategy Division within the Office of the CTO to partner with you to innovate, guide and architect IT solutions that fit your needs and support GSA IT's shared services model.

Please join Akanksha Sharma from the CTO Office in this Tech Talk to learn more about how Solutions Strategy is helping GSA move to a shared services model.  Furthermore, she will explain how to engage with the division for assistance with your current and future projects.
