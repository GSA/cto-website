Nov 16  Zero Trust Tech Talk with Bo Berlas

The President’s Executive Order (EO) on “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity (14028)” charges agencies to raise the cybersecurity bar, moving away from traditional perimeter-based, compliance oriented cybersecurity to a Zero Trust Architecture. This session will detail GSAs zero trust vision to connect GSA staff and devices, anywhere, to GSA managed environments/applications securely following ZTA principles in support of GSA's mission.
