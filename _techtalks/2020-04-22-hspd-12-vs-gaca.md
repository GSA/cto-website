As GSA IT has expanded IT tools offerings and options for external access, questions have arisen about when HSPD-12 is required for vendors, and what alternate methods or mechanisms (e.g. GACA) can be used to share information? What are approved NIST 800-63 B Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) methods to be used for vendors and/or federal customers?

Join us for the upcoming Tech Talk for a Q&A session on this topic with Phil Klokis, Associate CIO for the Public Buildings IT Services, and Bo Berlas, the GSA Chief Information Security Officer.
