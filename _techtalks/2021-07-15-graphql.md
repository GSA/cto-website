GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries.

This tech talk will be an introduction to GraphQL, which will include core concepts like GraphQL Schema, Queries and Mutation.

We will also look at how GraphQL compares to other API technologies and finally touch up on how GraphQL fits into microservices architecture.
