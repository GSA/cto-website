Learn more about how the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) are being used to modernize GSA applications.  Hear about completed projects and projects on the horizon.

The goal is to transform agency systems from proprietary technologies to open source.

Transformation will simplify integrations with other systems; enable greater agility, resiliency, scalability, and performance, reduce the risk of scarce resource/talent pool and in long term lower the cost of operations, improve the quality of product, and help drive cultural change.
