## Please Join us for an explanation of how the 18F/TTS team leading the development of the National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC) has used privacy-preserving record linkage to protect the sensitive personally identifiable information of the ~40 million people applying for or receiving SNAP benefits.

## Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) is a process that identifies and links records that correspond to the same entity/individual across different databases, without revealing private information to the linking organization. The NAC’s specific application of PPRL techniques could serve as a reference model for protecting privacy in similar systems across the federal government.
