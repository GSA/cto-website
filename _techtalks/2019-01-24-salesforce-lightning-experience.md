Lightning Experience is Salesforce’s intuitive, intelligent interface, designed to support the way you work and help you be more productive.

With Lightning users can find insights more quickly, work more efficiently, and be connected across all devices.

During the Lightning Experience Tech Talk, Annie Egan from the ICPA team, will provide an overview about what Lightning is, highlight new and exciting features of the interface and discuss the Salesforce COE’s strategy for transitioning GSA to Lightning.
