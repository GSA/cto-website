GSA's RPA Program acts as the RPA Center of Excellence (COE) and the primary RPA Factory for GSA. The RPA Program is actively building and supporting automation efforts across GSA to include all CXOs. To date, the RPA Factory has delivered 90 automations and has a very healthy pipeline of automation projects. One unique feature of the GSA RPA Program is that the majority of the development is done by Government employees that have completed a rigorous training and certification program to “UpSkill” their capabilities and take advantage of this existing RPA technology.

The Federal RPA Community of Practice (CoP) was established to promote cross-government collaboration and the acceleration of the adoption of emerging technologies. We are focused on the aggregation and redistribution of federally based RPA "Best Practices and Lessons Learned". In addition, we openly collaborate with Federal RPA Programs to address many common implementation hurdles, process challenges and technical barriers. All in an effort to provide knowledge based, foundational support for Agencies to help them navigate their respective RPA journeys.
