IT systems must account for ever-increasing sophistication of business expectations and demands.

To satisfy them, we must think in terms of AI/ML, RPA, Dynamic BPM etc. But what does it mean to embed these capabilities into the architectures that we are designing and/or modernizing?

What are the practical considerations for designing robust, future-proof architectures? And is there a specificity for doing so within a Government-based IT organization?

That’s what we’ll attempt to address.
