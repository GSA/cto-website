Identifying the right problem to solve is often overlooked when planning a new project. Problems are often framed as, we need to achieve compliance with "X" rather than our solution should make it easier to comply with "X".

Going about this process in a systematic way can be a challenge, it's not every day that you work to tackle the big problems within an organization.

Sprint is a book written by two ex-Googler's who undertook many such challenges when working with clients to transform the way they work.

Sprint focuses on a 5 day, intensive set of sessions to break down issues, center the team on the right problems to solve, and produce prototypes quickly.
