The CDO office is working with various GSA stakeholders on a strategy and roadmap for data-related initiatives and investments.

Such GSA wide efforts will among others address data integration across the enterprise, analytics modeling and computing, data governance, and other opportunities that will allow GSA to avoid duplications and use data as a strategic asset. In this talk, Payman will present the core elements of the data strategy, vision for a GSA-wide data platform, and some of the related work that is already underway.
