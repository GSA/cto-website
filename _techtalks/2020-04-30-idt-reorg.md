The GSA IT Office of Digital Infrastructure Technologies (IDT), formerly the GSA IT Office of Infrastructure and Operations (IDI), is in the process of reorganizing in order to shift from project-based stovepipes into product-based plan|build|run or intake|broker|integrate|orchestrate teams.



The strategic value of this new business model lies in leveraging existing technology, resources and vendor relationships in a new utility service environment, while improving access and quality of services to clients, and reducing costs of delivery.



This Tech Talk will drill down into what Digital Transformation means to IDT, what benefits and changes customers can expect, and the activities IDT is initiating in order to innovate IT for tomorrow.
