Learn more about the GSA's EDMS system and how you can use it to help formalize the way you manage documents and electronic records.



During this presentation, we will explain what an EDMS is and how it can help your organization be more efficient.  We will also explain the difference between EDMS and Google Drive and when you should use each tool.



Finally, we will show the process for moving your content onto the EDMS so that you can prepare to work with the EDMS team if you are interested.
