Business Objects has been used for over 15 years as an integral part of financial

reporting services for GSA (PBS, FAS, CFO, HR) and external users.

Business Objects has the capability to be able to retrieve data from a variety of data

sources through Extract, Transform and Load processes.

GSA offices can request a Business Objects data set or report be built.

This presentation will include an overview of Public/Corporate Reports available and

how to request access to Business Objects.
