This talk is an overview of the GSA Readily Available Computing Environment (GRACE).

The GRACE is a cloud broker, designed for DevSecOps teams with a high level of technical proficiency.

We will go over GRACE capabilities today.

Also we will go over what will be improved, and what GRACE will be sharing with the greater community in the future.
