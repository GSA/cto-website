The Mulesoft Anypoint Platform focuses on unlocking data and building an application network via an API driven approach.

The Anypoint Platform is a suite of tools that allows users to develop, deploy, manage, secure and collaborate on APIs.

GSA is currently leveraging Mulesoft for Salesforce provisioning and there are projects underway in PBS and OGP.
