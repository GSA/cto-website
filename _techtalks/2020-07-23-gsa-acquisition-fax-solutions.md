GSA, do you still need the ability to fax? GSA IT (IQ) has the solution for you. Using FoIP and our Gmail we can assist you with your faxing needs.

Faxing is still widely used between GSA and its user community. It is, for the most, part reliable and inexpensive to communicate. Many of our business partners still use this protocol to send and receive information.

Teleworking has created the need for "Virtual Faxing" and GSA employees can now send and receive faxes from their laptops. Physical fax machines are becoming a thing of the past.

The combination of FOIP and Gmail has allowed GSA users to now send and receive faxes. Faxing has always been a low cost portal for communication between GSA and its Faxing trading partners.
