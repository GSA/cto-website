GS-230001,Solicitation Review Tool (SRT),GSA,OGP,"The SRT intakes SAM.gov data for all Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solicitations. The system then compiles the data into a database to be used by machine learning algorithms. The first of these is a Natural Language Processing model that determines if a solicitation contains compliance language. If a solicitation does not have compliance language, then it is marked as non-compliant. Each agency is asked to review their data and validate the SRT predictions.  GSA also conducts random manual reviews monthly.",Operation and Maintenance,1/26/2018,1/26/2018,9/15/2018,In-House,Yes,,Natural Language Processing (NLP); Intelligent Document Recognition (IDR); Optical Character Recognition (OCR); Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR); Robotic Process Automation (RPA); Machine Learning,Agency generated,Yes,https://github.com/GSA/srt-api,Yes,Yes

Once the Contracting Officer (CO) has received vendor proposals for a solicitation and is ready to perform the evaluation process, the CO will initiate evaluation by sending solicitation documents along with all associated vendor proposal documents to the Source Selection module, which will pass all documents to CALI. CALI will process the documents, associated metadata and begin analyzing the proposals in four key areas: format compliance, forms validation, reps & certs compliance, and requirements compliance. The designated evaluation members can review the evaluation results in CALI and submit finalized evaluation results back to the Source Selection module.  CALI is currently being trained with sample data from the EULAs under the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program.",Implementation,10/1/2020,Dev began - Oct 2021,ATO - 9/2022,Contracted,No,,Natural Language Processing,Agency generated,No,,,
