# Background

Innovative authentication goes beyond the traditional username and password methods. Instead, we will explore new and innovative ways of credentialing and user management.



# Possible Applications at GSA

Currently at GSA there have been several efforts involving Innovative Authentication. The concept goes well beyond the days of simple username and password. Both the near and long-term future of Innovative Authentication methods and technologies. We are seeing a move towards user-friendly innovative advancements, which promotes multi-factor authentication for everyone, everywhere. Multi-factor ensures our workforce and customers all have options available for using two of the: what you have, what you know or what you are methods to login to our applications. 

 Below are some current use cases moving GSA further along the modernization path to create more sustainable, user friendly and accessible options, and advance our journey towards Zero Trust architectures. Individually, these efforts are not entirely futuristic. However, the alignment and final results will allow more robust capabilities so that the framework is in place to support many of the truly innovative next-gen authentication methods.

**Note**: These example efforts currently in work at GSA are part of its larger Zero Trust related strategies. Therefore we are highlighting some of their key features and approaches and will defer to other official communications and publications. We will publish links to these as they come available. 

**Two GSA Use Cases**

While authentication via CAC/PIV cards (ID badges) received a second government-wide push in 2010 with [OMB-11-11](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2011/m11-11.pdf), a decade of advancement has meant a significant increase in the number of physical tokens representing ‘things’ users must log to. While many Federal agencies have integrated and met the minimum guidelines, GSA has continued to add to its variety of methods which improve on use of CAC/PIV, particularly with respect to the increased demand for a work from anywhere culture.
