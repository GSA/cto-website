Chatbot for Federal Acquisition Community,"The introduction of a chatbot will enable the GSA FAS NCSC to streamline the customer experience process, and automate providing answers to documented commonly asked questions through public facing knowledge articles.  The end goal is this will reduce staffing requirements for NCSC’s live chat programs and allow the NCSC resources to be dedicated to other proactive customer services initiatives.  Customers will still have the option to connect to a live agent if they choose by requesting an agent.",Planned (not in production)

Classifying Qualitative Data with Medallia,"USA.gov has a lot of customer-driven qualitative data that we would like classified into topics: survey comments from multiple surveys, web chat transcripts, contact center agent case notes, and search box queries. We want to know what the topics of the text chunks are about. This is very challenging because of the massive diversity of USA.gov's content and topics covered. Medallia offers Natural Language Processing in which users can create rules based on words and their relationships with other words to tag qualtitative data with our topics (passports, tax refunds, etc.). We are focusing on this. Medallia also uses AI to do classifying on its own. However, this is a bit messy and we haven't had time to focus on deriving the most benefit from this. We want to use it to identify the arrival of new terms that we ourselves haven't noticed and submitted into the system yet so that we can respond with helpful web content. Finally, Medallia offers Sentiment Analysis, which we are also just starting to explore. Some of our data has quantitative survey responses already with it, which makes it less necessary. But some, like web chat transcripts, does not. So we are exploring how to take advantage of Sentiment Analysis.",In production
Contract Acquisition Lifecycle Intelligence (CALI),"CALI tool is an automated machine learning evaluation tool built to streamline the evaluation of vendor proposals against the solicitation requirements to support the Source Selection process. CALI is offered by Octo Consulting as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and is implemented and hosted within Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud US East and US West regions. Once the Contracting Officer (CO) has received vendor proposals for a solicitation and is ready to perform the evaluation process, the CO will initiate evaluation by sending solicitation documents along with all associated vendor proposal documents to Bizagi’s Source Selection module, which will pass all documents to CALI. CALI will process the documents, associated metadata and begin analyzing the proposals in four key areas: format compliance, forms validation, reps & certs compliance, and requirements compliance. The designated evaluation members can review the evaluation results in CALI and submit finalized evaluation results back to Source Selection in Bizagi.  CALI is currently being trained with sample data from the EULAs under the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program.  ",Planned (not in production)

ServiceNow Generic Ticket Classification,"We are building a model to take generic Service Now tickets and classify them so that they can be automatically re-routed to the correct team that handles these types of tickets. The process of re-routing generic tickets is currently done manually, so the model will allow us to automate it. The initial model will target the top 5 most common ticket types.",Planned (not in production)
Solicitation Review Tool (SRT),"The SRT intakes SAM.gov data for all ICT solicitations. The system then compiles the data into a database to be used by machine learning algorithms. The first of these is a Natural Language Processing model that determines if a solicitation contains compliance language. If a solicitation does not have compliance language, then it is marked as non-compliant. Each agency is asked to review their data and validate the SRT predictions.  GSA also conducts random manual reviews monthly.",In production
