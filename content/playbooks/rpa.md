## Introduction

**Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** is a business process automation technology that automates manual tasks that are largely **rules based, structured and repetitive** using software robots, also known as **bots**.  RPA tools map a process for a robot to follow which allows the bot to operate in place of a human.

RPA aligns with the President's agenda goals for IT Modernization (shown below).

The President's Management Agenda lists a goal and an opportunity. The goal is "Modernize IT to increase productivity and security". The opportunity is "There are opportunities to: expand the use of modern commercial technologies that are effective, economical, and secure; reduce the impact of cybersecurity risks by safeguarding IT systems, sensitive data, and networks; leverage common solutions and innovative practices to improve efficiency, increase security, and ultimately meet citizens' needs."](/assets/img/playbooks/rpa-top-down-strategy.png)


## Why RPA?

RPA enables employees to spend less time on routine tasks and focus more on challenging tasks on hand. RPA allows for:

- Better Customer Experience
- Minimal Error Rates
- Better Management Capabilities
- Transactional to Analytical Culture


## RPA Community of Practice

The [RPA Community of Practice (CoP)](https://digital.gov/communities/rpa/) is a government-wide initiative led by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and Technology Transformation Services (TTS) program offices to facilitate collaboration and problem solving between federal agencies that are interested in implementing RPA. The CoP shares information and resources and provides guidance for RPA implementation and operations. Government employees can join the FedRPA CoP by sending an email to [fedrpa-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov](mailto:fedrpa-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov).


## GSA RPA GitHub Repo

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has made the code accessible through GitHub for those looking to get started or learn more about RPA. The code powers a few of GSA’s bots that are currently being used by various teams.

- [GSA’s Credit Card Logging bot](https://github.com/GSA/Credit_Card_Logging_Bot)
