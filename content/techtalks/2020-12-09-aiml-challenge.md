The OCTO team worked with FAS IT Category staff to conduct an online challenge on the challenge.gov platform during summer 2020.

We asked teams to use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to improve the process of reviewing End User License Agreements (EULAs).

The challenge received 20 submissions from individuals, companies, and students.

Ryan Day of the OCTO will share what we learned about the technology and data science methods from these solvers.
