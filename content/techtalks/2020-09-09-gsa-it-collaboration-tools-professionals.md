Different teams communicate in different ways.  There's no one-size-fits-all solution that meets the needs of every business and operational need.

So how are folks supposed to know what's best for their activity?  GSA IT's service catalog includes a robust offering of Communications and Collaboration tools.

This Tech Talk provides a high level overview of the current offerings as well as touches on things to consider when determining what's best for your team.
