What problem are you trying to solve?

10x is an incremental investment program within GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS). 10x funds, supports, and develops ideas from federal employees about how technology can improve the public’s experience with the government.

Our approach to IT innovation is based on modern venture capital practices and is designed to spend fewer taxpayer dollars while ensuring the best products and services are funded.

10x spends the smallest amount of funding necessary at each stage of a project to determine whether or not it’s worth pursuing.

These iterative investments save money while ensuring that the products and services meet a real, verifiable need in the federal marketplace.
