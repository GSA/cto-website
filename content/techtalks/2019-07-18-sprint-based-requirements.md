Provide an overview of Sprint-based Requirements and how the Platform Solutions team (ICPA) applies it to development projects.

Sprint-based Requirements allow IT teams to work closely with their customers to collect requirements and create user stories following a typical agile sprint format that run for two weeks with defined business topics and scope to discover during the sprints.

This format ensures that the ICPA team has a proper understanding of how to setup Salesforce standard objects, configure workflows, and setup reports / dashboards based on the needs of the business line.
