A Tour of GitHub for Non-Developers: GitHub is a collaboration platform where users can work on open source projects together.

In this session, we’ll take a look at the many GitHub features and get you up to speed with version control terminology.

We’ll also take a look at a few workflows in GitHub for contributing to open source projects without coding.

This is a beginner friendly session for someone who has little to no experience with GitHub.
