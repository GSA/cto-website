Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are a valuable way to share data with mobile apps, websites, and computer systems. GSA publishes many APIs for use by the public and GSA programs.

But how do we make sure that GSA's APIs are high quality, secure, and consistent with each other? And how do we help people find and use our APIs?

This presentation will share the details of GSA's API Strategy, and the three areas we are focused on to make it a reality: External Customer Experience, Internal Engagement, and Technical Architecture.
