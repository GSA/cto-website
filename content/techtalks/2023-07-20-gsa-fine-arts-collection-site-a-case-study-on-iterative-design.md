 GSA’s Fine Arts Collection is one of the nation’s oldest and largest public art collections. Dating from the 1850s to the present, artworks are displayed in federal buildings and courthouses across the U.S., and many are on long-term loan to museums and other non-profit institutions. Join the Service Delivery and the Center of Fine Arts team to learn about how they used human-centered design best practices to develop and launch the new collection website (<https://art.gsa.gov/>).
