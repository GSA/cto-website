Small disadvantaged businesses continue to be a priority, as outlined in the recently released OMB memorandum M-23-11: Creating a More Diverse and Resilient Federal Marketplace through Increased Participation of New and Recent Entrants. The [Government-Wide Procurement Equity Tool](https://d2d.gsa.gov/report/government-wide-procurement-equity-tool) was developed to improve agencies’ analytic and market research capabilities, enabling users to quickly and easily find vendors registered in SAM, while cross-referencing key FPDS data, to help lead to a more diversified supplier base.  Join this Tech Talk to learn more about how you can use this tool to advance equity in procurement!
