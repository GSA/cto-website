In December 2021, President Biden signed an [Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/), which anchors government services directly to the experiences of our customers. At GSA, our Office of Customer Experience (OCE) supports GSA [Service and Staff Offices (SSOs)](https://insite.gsa.gov/services-and-offices) with guidance, training, and tools to improve customer experience (CX).

Join Dionne Cochran from OCE as she leads a dialogue on how to become more CX-minded, and shares how tools such as Qualtrics can help you learn what your customers need, so you can improve services to meet those needs.
