Have you ever been interested in machine learning but didn't know how to start? Lindsay Young will share her tribulations in making a simple machine learning app.

She'll go over how it works and what code libraries are available for exploration. You will get an understanding of what situations make for good machine learning opportunities, and how to evaluate your options to know if you should use it for a given task.
