I﻿DEAS Champion Tech Talk 

What does DEIA have to do with IT?

As the American public become increasingly more diverse, how will GSA’s technology rise to meet those needs?  Could DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Accessibility) best practices generate more human-centered technology solutions? 

Join Marvin Heath from the IDEA Champions program, as he leads a dialogue envisioning how we can all create a more inclusive technology future, including a proposed DEIA in IT Bill of Rights.
