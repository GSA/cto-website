Use case of GIS enterprise tools: GSA Publishes First Map of Executive Branch-owned and Controlled Real Property.

GSA published recently a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled map of the federal government’s centralized inventory of real property.

The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) Management System data, lists property under the custody and control of executive branch agencies, and is posted in accordance with the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 and represents the federal government’s inventory as of September 30, 2017.

The interactive map includes search and filter capabilities to view and assess the federal government’s real property holdings.

The public can use the tool to search for federal property in a certain geographic area, sort by federal agency and access information including whether the property is utilized, underutilized or not utilized.
