We greatly value our contractor colleagues. They are amazing and help us deliver for our customers everyday. But did you know there is a ‘separation of duties’ between feds and contractors that keeps us all protected? 

Our OGC colleagues, Marie Cochran and Lauren Jacobs, are hosting this feds-only training for GSA IT to help us understand the dos/don’ts of these important relationships. 

Marie & Lauren will leave plenty of time for questions during the session. 

Hope you can join! 

**NOTE**: This is feds-only; contractors & embedded contractors cannot attend.
