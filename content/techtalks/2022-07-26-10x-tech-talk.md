We've all had those "eureka" moments, right? Like "what if this idea could make it easier for government customers to get what they need"? Well, did you know that GSA's TTS runs a program called [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/) for gov employees with great ideas? They select new ideas on a rolling basis and get some of the brightest minds in gov tech working on how to actualize winning ideas in partnership with other fed agencies. In this Tech Talk you'll hear from GSA IT's Monica Fitzgerald who has had two very different ideas accepted. She'll share about the process, offer tips on how to best write up and submit ideas, and even demo a project born of an idea she submitted that is destined to go live on USA.gov
