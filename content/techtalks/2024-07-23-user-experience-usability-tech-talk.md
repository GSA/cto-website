July 23 Tech Talk User Experience & Usability  w/Maria Cossio & Steve Gillespie   



GSA IT Service Desk Portal: A case study on research-driven design 

At our last Tech Talk, we shared the updates made to the GSA IT Service Desk Portal. Join the GSA IT Office Of Digital Infrastructure Technologies (IDT) and the GSA IT Usability Team again to learn about their human-centered design approach that made these enhancements to the GSA IT Service Desk Portal possible. 



IDT's Steve Gillespie and the GSA IT Usability Team's Maria Cossio will discuss how the two teams partnered together to improve the user experience of the Service Desk Portal. Maria will share how the team learned about users' needs through user research and used iterative design processes to create the updated user interface. 



Join us to see how user research data can be used to guide design and business decisions.
