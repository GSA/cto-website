Google Apps Script, also know as Google Scripts, is a free programming language mostly based on an earlier version of JavaScript.

It includes built-in libraries for Google Workplace apps, but it's flexible enough to bridge other development platforms, an example being HTML. This is a free of cost solution and no installation is required since the code editor is web-based. Many GSA employees use Google Scripts on a daily basis to enable data automation; in a way, it's our in-house "robotics" solution.
