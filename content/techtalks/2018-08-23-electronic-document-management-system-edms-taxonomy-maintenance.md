Learn more about how the Taxonomy is used and managed within the GSA EDMS (Electronic Document Management System). We will pick up the discussion where we left off in the previous EDMS Tech Talk and Taxonomy Tech Talk.

During the presentation, we  will focus on the EDMS Teamâ€™s taxonomy governance process by showing how changes to terms and structure are identified and implemented.

Finally, we will discuss how GSA can readily use and share existing taxonomies and authority control sources to enhance metadata and achieve interoperability.
