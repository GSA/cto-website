We greatly value our contractor colleagues. They are amazing and help us deliver for our customers everyday. But did you know there is a ‘separation of duties’ between feds and contractors that keeps us all protected? 

An OGC colleague, Marie Cochran, is hosting this feds-only training for GSA IT to help us understand the dos/don’ts of these important relationships.

This tech talk will focus on Terms & Conditions related issues in the GSA/IT contractor relationship.

Marie will leave plenty of time for questions during the session. 

Hope you can join! 

NOTE: This is feds-only; contractors & embedded contractors cannot attend.
