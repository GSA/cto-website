Recently, GSA's Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM), the office that manages the GSA SmartPay® ️ program, partnered with GSA's Service Delivery Team to build and launch a new [program website](http://smartpay.gsa.gov/), [training website](http://training.smartpay.gsa.gov/), and [889 tool](http://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/).



CCCM's Rebekah Knouse Perillo will discuss her experience with building the sites as a new Product Owner. Topics will include content reduction, adoption of agile best practices, and how their new products are already reducing burden.



Hope you can join this tech talk!
