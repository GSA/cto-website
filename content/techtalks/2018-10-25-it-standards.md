Whatâ€™s new with IT Standards?

The IT Standards team is back!!  We want to share updates, proposed changes, and tips to make the approval process easier.

Did you know that not all IT requests need to go through the approval process? How are we working to improve the GEAR IT Standards list?  Can I search for an approved software by using the Category?

The IT Standards team wants to hear from you!  Please join us at the Tech Talk and bring your questions.

We look forward to seeing you on October 25th!
