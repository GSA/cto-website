Cloud.gov is the TTS-operated platform-as-a-service for the federal government.

So, what is it, how does it work, and how can you get started with it?

Peter with the cloud.gov team will walk you through deploying a database-backed web application, and illustrate how cloud.gov is different from other cloud offerings.

In particular, the Cloud Foundry-based PaaS offloads much of the work that IaaSes require for security and compliance -- saving you money and vastly speeding up time to delivery.
