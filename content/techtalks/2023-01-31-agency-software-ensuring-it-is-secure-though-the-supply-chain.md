Ensuring software integrity is key to protecting Federal systems from threats and vulnerabilities and reducing overall risk from cyber-attacks. Recent federal mandates around cybersecurity are driving changes to how software is developed. A key milestone in the recently issued [OMB M-22-18](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/M-22-18.pdf) requires that vendors attest that they follow NIST standards for a risk-based approach for secure software development. Come learn more about GSA's work to implement the requirements of this memo.
