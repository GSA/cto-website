**Updated GSA IT Self Service Portal and ServiceNow TechTalk**

GSA IT continues to help drive technology transformation by providing employees with the tools they need and the GSA IT Service Desk is committed to providing you with excellent customer service in delivering and supporting those tools. The GSA IT Self Service Portal is your gateway to request, track and learn about available IT Services and request support.



The much appreciated comments we received from GSA's 2024 Annual IT Survey identified the need to make the IT ticket process easier. In response we have reviewed all and updated many of the service names and descriptions to use plain language and provide a better description of the service being offered. We have also enhanced the GSA IT Self Service Portal layout and interface to make navigating the portal and submitting and tracking a ticket easier.Â 



These enhancements to the GSA IT Self Service Portal are scheduled to be rolled out very soon so please come join us to learn about the changes coming to improve your IT support experience.
