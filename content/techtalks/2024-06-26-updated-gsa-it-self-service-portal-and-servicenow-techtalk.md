GSA IT continues to help drive technology transformation by providing employees with the tools they need, and the GSA IT Service Desk is committed to providing you with excellent customer service in delivering and supporting those tools. The GSA IT Service Desk Portal (formerly known as the GSA IT Self Service Portal) is your gateway to request, track, and learn about available IT Services and request support.

The comments we received from GSA's 2024 Annual IT Survey identified the need to make the IT ticket process easier. In response, we partnered with GSA ITâ€™s Usability Team and have updated the service request names and descriptions to use plain language and provide a better description of the services offered. We have also enhanced the GSA IT Service Desk Portal layout and interface to make submitting and tracking a ticket easier.

Join us to learn about these enhancements to improve your IT support experience.
