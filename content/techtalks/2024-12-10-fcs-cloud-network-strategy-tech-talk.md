Cloud Network Strategy Tech Talk:As part of multiyear cloud network modernization strategy, GSA IT/FCS has migrated to our new multi-cloud distributed network architecture reducing potential for cross-tenant impacts while increasing intra-vpc throughput by 100x and incorporating IPv6 readiness. FCS partnered closely with GSA security to develop future state architecture with baked-in firewall integration and modern DNS architecture, while decommissioning legacy Cisco devices and adopting cloud native services. We will use this forum to share architectural patterns, methodology and some lessons learned with the community.
