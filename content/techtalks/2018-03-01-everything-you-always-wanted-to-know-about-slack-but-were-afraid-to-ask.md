Slack is a chat client that provides a centralized way to communicate in channels that you want--about projects that matter to you--without overloading your inbox. The name is actually an acronym for "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge". It will not replace our current tools such as gmail, hangouts, google docs, Chatter etcâ€¦ In fact, within Slack you can share links to content from those tools in a seamless way, to work directly with team members on specific projects. For example, if you work with a core group of people on a project, you can work within a specific channel (that you can request be created) to converse, share documents, and have a searchable log of all of your activity.
