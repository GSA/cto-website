title: Conducting a Daily Scrum / Stand-up
category: Agile
---

The **Daily Scrum / Stand-up** allows the Scrum Team to highlight what they are working on and any impediments to progress. It provides the opportunity for rapid communication and decision-making; ensuring issues don’t "fall through the cracks" and eliminating the need for lengthy status meetings that may drag on.

While the Scrum Master may facilitate the Daily Scrum / Stand-up, it is the Scrum Team who conducts the session, “inspecting and adapting” as they work to achieve the sprint goal. The Product Owner and management may attend, but only as “silent observers” - available to provide clarification on user stories or to assume responsibility for impediments that need escalation.


## Daily Scrum / Stand-up Best Practices

The Daily Scrum / Stand-up gets it name from the huddle-like appearance of a rugby scrum. Similarly, Scrum Team members “huddle” in-person, or virtually, around their working board or electronic tool (i.e. JIRA, Trello, GitHub, etc.). Team members are encouraged to stand in order to keep the meeting timeboxed to *no more* than 15 minutes. Any member can start the Daily Scrum / Stand-up as the Team should be prompt (i.e. no need to wait for stragglers) and respectful of each other’s time. **Only** individuals working directly on the effort should participate. The Scrum Team should communicate their updates using the following three questions:

* What did you do yesterday?
* What are you doing today?
* Do you have any blockers / impediments?


## Fostering Communication

While the Daily Scrum / Stand-up should never be the sole means of communication, it is an effective ceremony for promoting team collaboration. When the ability to have face-to-face conversation is impeded, Stand-ups can also be conducted via collaboration tools, with some even offering “Stand-up bots” that remind the Scrum Team to add their updates (e.g. Slack). Remember, the Daily Scrum / Stand-up is **not** a status meeting. The goal is for the Scrum Team to *quickly* communicate progress, unearth obstacles, and make needs for assistance or additional work known - not belabor issues or introduce new topics. If necessary, follow-up discussions can scheduled with the appropriate parties by the Scrum Master or Product Owner.
