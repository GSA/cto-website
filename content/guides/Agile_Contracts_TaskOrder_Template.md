title: Agile Contracts- Task Order Template
category: Agile
---

This content provides contract language guidance and is intended to serve as a template for the government representative during the development of a Task Order under an Agile BPA. The sample language provided here can be used to clearly outline and communicate the high-level objectives and task-level delivery requirements of the intended product / service in line with an Agile delivery process. Additionally, this Task Order structure enables the government to allow contractors to work in a flexible way while maintaining high expectations for code quality and successful agile project management.

[GSA Tech Guides](/guides/) also provides additional content and guidelines that delve further into and provide concrete tools/techniques on requirement breakdown and relevant sizing approaches to encourage delivery on an Agile project. Some example content include:

* [Conducting an Agile Project](/guides/conducting_an_agile_project/)
* [Managing Requirements in an Agile Environment](/guides/managing_requirements/)
* [Defining When a Requirement is Complete](/guides/requirements_complete/)
* [Estimation and Relative Sizing](/guides/estimation_and_storypointing/)

Moreover, [Interview Questions for Agile Vendors](/guides/agile_contracts_interview_questions_for_agile_vendors/) and Specific [Agile Roles](/guides/agilecontracts_interview_questions_for_agile_roles/) contents provde further guidance for GSA staff on what to inquire and expect from contractors during the vetting process.
