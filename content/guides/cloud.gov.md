[Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provided by [Technology Transformation Services](https://tts.gsa.gov/). It is designed for use by federal agencies. The Office of the CTO is targeting cloud.gov as our primary hosting platform.

As a GSA user, you automatically have access to cloud.gov and the GSA `sandbox-gsa` organization, where you can experiment with test deployments. The best place to get started is the [cloud.gov docs](https://docs.cloud.gov/). Whenever the documentation refers to an "organization" or "org", you can use `sandbox-gsa`. You also have a personal sandbox space named after your email address. For instance, if your email address is harry.truman@gsa.gov, then your space name is `harry.truman`.

Since cloud.gov is built with [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/), the Cloud Foundry [documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/) is also an useful resource.
