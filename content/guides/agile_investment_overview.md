## What is the Agile Investment Process?

All pilots begin with an approved Business concept. Once the Product Owner and Scrum Team members are identified, the CTO Office then engages the right resources for [Discovery](/guides/agile_investment_discovery_phase_checklist/) that will lead into the [Proof of Concept (PoC)](/guides/agile_investment_proof-of-concept_phase_checklist/) phase and beyond.

* All projects derive from approved Business concepts
* All projects engage the right resources for success
* Not all pilots lead to prototype / scalable solutions
