title: Agile Contracts- PWS Template
category: Agile
---

This content provides contract language guidelines and is intended to serve as a template for the government representative during the development of a Performance Work Statement (PWS) under an Agile BPA. The sample language provided here can be used to clearly outline and communicate the background, objectives, and delivery requirements of the intended product / service in-line with an Agile delivery process.

[GSA Tech Guides](/guides/) also provides additional content and guidelines that delve further into and provide concrete tools/techniques on requirement breakdown and relevant sizing approaches to encourage delivery on an Agile project. Some example content include:

* [Conducting an Agile Project](../conducting_an_agile_project/)
* [Managing Requirements in an Agile Environment](../managing_requirements/)
* [Defining When a Requirement is Complete](../requirements_complete/)
* [Estimation and Relative Sizing](../estimation_and_storypointing/)

Moreover, [Interview Questions for Agile Vendors](../agile_contracts_interview_questions_for_agile_vendors/) and Specific [Agile Roles](../agilecontracts_interview_questions_for_agile_roles/) contents provde further guidance for GSA staff on what to inquire and expect from contractors during the vetting process.

User needs will be prioritized based on business value and technical dependencies in {name of application used for managing the product backlog}."*

### Performance Objectives

[Use this section to outline Objectives for the Task Order. Objective summarizes the Product Vision, High-level technical functions, high-level business functions, Primary end-users and their high-level needs (if applicable), the development approach and description of systems to be used (if applicable), ongoing process for evaluating and determining changing scope]

*"{Name of organization} is seeking the creation of {feature name} prototype of {name of system}. The new {name of system} will {desired high-level functionality} and meet evolving requirements while leveraging Agile best practices in software development including but not limited to; open source code, human-centered design, and with an extensible infrastructure and robust communication between the product sponsor and the project team.”*

*“A minimum viable product (MVP) of this system is expected within the first {Time frame} under this task order. It is the Agency’s desire that the critical components, which are defined as “must haves” in priority (see {section name requirements}), are included to the greatest extent possible in the MVP. The MVP, which emerges out of user testing, must fall within the scope of the Product Vision as described in the statement of work or statement of objectives.
