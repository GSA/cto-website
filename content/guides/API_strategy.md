[The GSA API Strategy](/assets/cms/files/GSAAPIStrategy.pdf) describes GSA’s direction for agency­-wide API design, development, architecture, operations and support, and security. We want to use public APIs to expose public data for transparency, data consumer engagement, and application development. We also want to use non-public APIs to promote system integration and migration of legacy systems. In all these efforts, we seek to adopt industry best practices for API design, development, and management.

## API Strategy Implementation Approach

The following diagram demonstrates the three-pillar approach we are following to implement this strategy:

![API Strategy image listing the 3 pillars of Implementation: External Customer Experience, Internal Engagement, and Technical Architecture](/assets/cms/guides/api_3_pillars.png "3 Pillars of Implementation")

## Pillar 1: External Customer Experience

Providing APIs and API documentation that fulfill the needs of customers. Designing from a user-focused perspective, rather than technology-focused. The [GSA API Directory](https://open.gsa.gov/api) and [Self-service API Documentation Hosting](https://github.com/GSA/open-gsa-redesign/blob/master/APIDOCS.md) are the primary methods of implementing this. We also plan to implement Human Centered Design (HCD) techniques to enhance our developer experience.

## Pillar 2: Internal Engagement

Building a community of API owners and practitioners inside GSA to develop APIs in a consistent fashion. The [GSA API Standards](/guides/api_standards), [GSA API Guild](/apiguild), and [GSA API Management Portfolio](/apiportfolio) are key components of this pillar.

## Pillar 3: Technical Architecture

Designing technology solutions for developing and hosting high quality APIs. Creating technical guides to assist teams in implementing APIs that follow the [GSA API Standards](/guides/api_standards).
